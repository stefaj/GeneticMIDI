# GeneticMIDI
.NET application to algorithmically generate music using Genetic Algorithms, Markov Chains and Neural Networks.

# Notes
For anyone interested in this, this is an older project utilising GAs and Markov Models in order to generate music algorithmically. I think that modern Deep Learning approaches with recurrent neural networks will produce better sounding melodies. At the time of writing this most good algorithmic composition approaches still use post processing in order to generate good sounding melodies (this repo lacks this step).
